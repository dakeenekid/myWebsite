    <h3>All About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Davis Keene. I am 16 years old, and I was born in the suburb of Needham, Massachusettes. I have two sisters and a pet lizard, Ace.</p>
    <b>Current Academic Information: 
    </b>
    <p>GPA: Freshman Year 4.46, (Current) Sophmore Year 4.78</p>
    <p>Education: Sophmore, Class of 2019</p>
    <p>Biology E/M SAT2 score: 760</p>
    <h3>Previous Technological Experiences:</h3>
    <p>
        I currently am apart of T-10 Robotics (Team 4096) club at my highschool. As a freshman, a few teammates and I worked with Legacy Modules and Tetrix to develop a fully-functioning robot which would be used to drive around at state and regional-level contests, boasting school spirit. The robot had a live-feed camera within a hull controlled by two servos to drive the robot around from a stationary position. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to this, I have done experience with web development and unity programming when I was as little as 10-11 years old. My cousin and I made a website using Adobe Dreamweaver. <a href="http://www.funblade.com">This is it</a>. While it wasn't much, and I didn't understand what the ocde meant, it was a great learning experience and got me started down an aspiration towards computer science.
    </p>
    <p>This year, as an experienced sophmore, I am in charge of teaching the freshman object oriented programming and how to develop a robot. I learned to program through codecademy and self-teaching myself with modules such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
    <p>
        The T-10 Robotics team and I were able to travel to Scranton, PA to compete in a super regional contest. We lost there, unfortunatley, but it was awesome to have had the experience and the support to get there in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        For community service, a few friends of mine and I will be teaching kids no older than 13 the basics of computer science through tools such as scratch by MIT and by having them create their very own game.
    </p>

    <h2> A little more about myself...</h2>
<p> I have quite a few hobbies, beyond the realm of avid programming. </p>
<h3> How yoyoing has changed my life...</h3>
    <p> Yes, you read that correctly. Yoyoing, the hobby of using and competing with yoyos, has irriversably changed my outlook on life.</p>
    <p> When I was 10, I saw a yoyoist perform at my local library, and instantly knew that a passion of mine was to become as good as he was. He could walk the dog, he could walk the cat, and shoot the moon. I bought my first yoyo, the Yomega Maverick, and from then on I taught myself using determination and hours of YouTube and YoyoExpert.</p>
    <p> I quickly learned that yoyoing was so much more than just a fun hobby. It was a global competition to become the best. So, for the next six years, I have developed my skills and yoyo mastery into what it is today: nothing short of <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_8jTFulLg>amazing</a>, and I quickly became intersted in the business aspect of the sport. </p>
    <p> I created my own company, known as Tropic Spins, and partnered wih kids around the country to help it thrive and grow. We sold more than 250 yoyos nationally and became good friends. We learned how to run a business, how to market, and how to make instagram a great advertiser for products. We needed to make a website, and I was very intersted in technology, so I learned basic HTML and CSS to do the job, before giving up and using weebly instead. However, this sparked my interest in coding, and once I signed up for a codecademy course the rest was history. Simply put, the yoyo helped me achieve my accomplishments in technology, and I owe it to the hobby that I am able to develop my own programs.</p>
